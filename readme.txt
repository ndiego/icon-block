== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get more icons? =

Currently, the Icon Block only includes the WordPress icon library. That said, the plugin allows you to render **any** SVG-based icon by simply copy/pasting the code into the icon textarea when using the "Add custom icon" option! See the screenshots for reference. This gives you complete flexibility and allows you to use practically any icon you want. A great source for free SVG icons is Google's Material Icons project, Font Awesome, and Iconic, just to name a few.

= Why is my icon not changing color? =

The Icon Block includes controls for the icon's color and background. However, if your SVG icon has hard coded color/fill values, the plugin will respect those instead of any applied custom colors.

= Why is the block not working for certain users? =

WordPress only allows Administrators and Editors to save SVG content. The Icon Block will not work properly for users who are at the Author level or lower.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Icon Block includes the WordPress icon library allowing you to quickly and easily insert 270+ graphics.
2. Create your own custom icons by simply copy/pasting the SVG code. Then modify the icon to suit your needs.
3. The Icon Block comes with numerous icon controls such as color, rotation, alignment, padding, and border radius.
4. Whether you need a big icon, or a small one, the Icon Block adapts to your layout. Give it a try with the Row block in Gutenberg!
5. Use the "quick inserter", to quickly pick the WordPress icon you need.
6. The WordPress icon library modal is complete with categories, search, and preview size functionality.
7. Custom icons are added via their own insertion modal with a large textarea and the ability to preview the SVG code.
8. You are not limited to traditional icons. Any SVG-based graphic will work as well. The block will respect any hard coded color/fill values in the provided SVG.
