The Icon Block plugin registers a single, easy-to-use block that allows you to add custom SVG icons and graphics to the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg). The plugin also includes the complete WordPress icon library with 290+ SVG icons.

### Key features

- 290+ native WordPress icons, including social logos
- Use any custom SVG icon or graphic
- Insert icons from your Media Library if SVG uploads are supported
- Includes handy icon controls (link, rotate, alignment, colors, border, padding, margin, etc.)
- Fully compatible with the Site Editor
- No block library required ðŸŽ‰
- Built almost entirely with native WordPress components
- Will get additional functionality as it's added to WordPress core
- Register your own custom icon library. [Learn more](https://nickdiego.com/adding-custom-icons-to-the-icon-block/).

## Extensibility

The Icon Block includes several extensibility features that allow you to tailor the block to meet your needs.

### Hooks & Filters

#### `iconBlock.icons`

Filters all icons available in the built-in icon library. Use this filter to add or remove icons from the plugin. [Learn more](https://nickdiego.com/adding-custom-icons-to-the-icon-block/).

#### `iconBlock.enableCustomIcons`

Defaults to `true`, this filter allows you to enable or disable custom SVG icon functionality. When disabled, you are restricted from using the icon library.

```
wp.hooks.addFilter(
	'iconBlock.enableCustomIcons',
	'example-theme/disable-custom-icons',
	() => false
);
```

### theme.json

You can easily disable border and spacing settings in the Editor UI if your theme includes a theme.json file.

```
{
	...
	"settings": {
		...
		"blocks": {
			"outermost/icon-block": {
				"border": {
					"color": false,
					"radius": false,
					"style": false,
					"width": false
				},
				"spacing": {
					"margin": false,
					"padding": false
				}
			},
...
```
